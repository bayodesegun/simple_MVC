# simple_MVC
A simple app demonstrating basic MVC concepts without the use of a framework.

# Assumptions/Decisions taken.
* Login is not required to use the app.
* Application could easily have been done with an MVC framework (faster and easier), which might be more suitable in a team environment, but I decided to do it the "manual" way to stretch my knowledge of MVC and PHP.
